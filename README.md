# Chaos Compiler Collection [![](https://github.com/chaoticgd/ccc/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/chaoticgd/ccc/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

A set of tools for reverse engineering PS2 games.

## Tools

### stdump

Symbol table parser and dumper. It can extract the following information:

- Functions including parameters and local variables
- Global variables
- Types (structs, unions, enums, etc)

The following output formats are supported:

- C++
- JSON

The JSON output can be fed into the included `ImportStdumpSymbolsIntoGhidra.java` script, which will import functions, global variables and data types into [Ghidra](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra). **Ghidra 10.1 or later is required.** The script is intended to be used alongside the [ghidra-emotionengine](https://github.com/beardypig/ghidra-emotionengine) extension. The procedure for using this script on a fresh file is as follows:

1. Run the script **before** running auto analysis.
2. Run auto analysis, making sure to enable the "Use Deprecated Demangler" setting for the `Demangler GNU` analyser if the program you're analysing uses the old GNU mangling. We also recommend running the `MIPS-R5900 Constant Reference` analyzer included with ghidra-emotionengine, as well as `Variadic Function Signature Override`.

Note that the Ghidra script currently has some trouble with certain games.

### objdump

Half-working EE core MIPS disassembler. Probably not too interesting.

## Building

	cmake -B bin/
	cmake --build bin/

### Version History

| Version | Changes |
| - | - |
| 4 | Added optional is_const property to all nodes. Added 'anonymous_reference' type names, where the type name is not valid but the type number is. |
| 3 | Added optional relative_path property to function definition nodes. |
| 2 | Added vtable_index property to function type nodes. |
| 1 | First version. |
